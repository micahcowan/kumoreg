Security Rights
===============

Rights are individual strings that are checked to enable/disable features for a certain user. Names are not case 
sensitive, and should have underscores between words.

Available rights are:

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: When an override is entered, the user gets all edit rights that the overriding user has in
a single attendee edit window. For example, attendee_override_price.

Rights can be added/removed from a given Role in the regular user interface.


Adding new rights
-----------------
Currently there's no interface for adding rights in the UI (since they're only useful from code).
If you add one, make sure to add it to LoadTestDataPresenter (loads default roles/rights/badges/etc) along
with setting it in the appropriate Role. 

The name should be self explanatory.
